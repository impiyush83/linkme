2. Install MongoDB Community Server edition version ```3.3.5```.
3. On command line type ```mongo``` and hit enter. (Will run Mongo on its default port ```27017```)
5. Go to root directory of *linkme* project.
6. On command line type ```npm install``` and hit enter.
7. On command line type ```npm start``` and hit enter.
- Yay! ðŸŽ‰ our server is up and running on default port ```3000```.
- Go through below docs, to understand the ```Entities``` and supported ```API```'s.
- Optional: You can also run test cases by ```npm test```.

## Assumptions

- This is a similar to linktree 
- No auth service is developed, it is assumed that user is logged in. 
- To know which user is hitting the API we are adding userId for the post request in ProductRating API.
- Every *user can add any number of links*. 


## Explanation

- As per the, linkme service it is should be  read-heavy than compared to writes. At peak times, if a  product a trending the writes can be heavy. 
-  We will focus on retrieval of ratings. Hence, as it is **read heavy**. 
-  Also among all the NOSQL DB's we have chosen *MongoDB* document data store, because it provides atomicity at the document level & is strongly consistent (providing CP of the CAP theorem).

## Entities:

- User, Links are the 2 collections formed.

---

## Schema 

- Used https://github.com/arb/celebrate for schema validation.
